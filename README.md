This template gives you everything needed to publish a professional PowerShell module — build pipeline, Pester tests, PSScriptAnalyzer, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and PowerShell Gallery publishing — all wired together and ready to go. It's the standard base for all [Chris Taylor Codes](https://github.com/christaylorcodes) projects, and other repos reference back here for shared conventions and tooling.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create your repo from the template

Click **"Use this template"** at the top of this repository, name your new repo, and clone it locally.

### 2. Let the agent set it up

Open the project in your AI coding tool (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) and tell it:

> Help me initialize this as a new PowerShell module. Read AGENTS.md for project context.

The agent will walk you through naming your module, running the initialization script, updating placeholders, and validating the result — no checklist required.

### 3. Or run the script directly

```powershell
.\Scripts\Initialize-Repository.ps1 -Name "MyModule" `
                                     -Description "What it does" `
                                     -Author "Your Name" `
                                     -GitHubUsername "your-username" `
                                     -InitializeGit
```

This renames module files, populates the manifest, replaces all placeholders, and initializes git.

> For manual step-by-step setup, badge generation, validation, and troubleshooting, see the [Template Usage Guide](docs/TEMPLATE_USAGE.md).

## AI Agents

This repository is designed for AI-assisted development from the ground up. Whether you're using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, or another AI coding tool, the agents have everything they need to contribute effectively.

**For agents working in this repo:**

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — Full project context: architecture, build commands, conventions, and workflow
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — Claude Code session workflow and planning system

**For agents working in other repos that use this template:**

- Link back to this repo's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for shared conventions
- The same build system, test framework, and code style apply across all projects

**AI workflow features:**

- Issue templates structured for AI consumption (`ai-task`, `ai-ready` labels)
- PR template with AI contribution checkbox
- [Initialize-Labels.ps1](Scripts/Initialize-Labels.ps1) sets up AI workflow labels on your repo
