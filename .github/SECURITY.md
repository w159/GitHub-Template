## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this template and its users seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Navigate to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form with details

2. **Direct Email**
   - Send an email to: **security@christaylor.codes**
   - Use the subject line: `[SECURITY] Project Name - Brief Description`

3. **Private Message on Slack**
   - Contact **@CTaylor** on [MSPGeek Slack](https://join.mspgeek.com/)
   - Clearly mark the message as security-related

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., code injection, privilege escalation, information disclosure)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it
- **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
- **Your assessment of severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report:

1. **Acknowledgment** - We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours**
2. **Initial Assessment** - We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within **5 business days**
3. **Updates** - We will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement
4. **Verification** - We may ask you to verify that our fix resolves the vulnerability
5. **Public Disclosure** - We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure
6. **Credit** - We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | 48 hours |
| Initial Assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix Development | Varies by severity |
| Release | Coordinated with reporter |

### Severity Levels

We use the [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) scoring system to assess vulnerability severity:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)** - Fix within 24-48 hours
- **High (7.0-8.9)** - Fix within 1 week
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)** - Fix within 2-4 weeks
- **Low (0.1-3.9)** - Fix in next regular release

## Security Best Practices for Template Users

When using this template for your own project, please:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update PowerShell modules and any other dependencies
   - Enable Dependabot alerts in your repository settings

2. **Secure Your Secrets**
   - Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
   - Use environment variables or secure secret storage
   - Review the `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files are excluded

3. **Code Review**
   - Review all scripts before execution, especially `Scripts\Initialize-Repository.ps1`
   - Understand what automation scripts do before running them
   - Use `-WhatIf` parameter when available

4. **PowerShell Execution Policy**
   - Be cautious when using `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
   - Prefer signed scripts in production environments
   - Review script signatures when available

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Run `Scripts\Test-Template.ps1` regularly to check for issues
   - Review and update this SECURITY.md for your project's needs
   - Monitor GitHub security advisories for dependencies

## Known Security Considerations

### PowerShell Script Execution

The template includes PowerShell scripts that modify files on your system:
- `Scripts\Initialize-Repository.ps1` - Modifies template files
- `Scripts\Test-Template.ps1` - Reads files and makes web requests (when link checking enabled)
- `Scripts\New-TemplateBadges.ps1` - Can modify README.md

**Recommendations:**
- Review scripts before execution
- Run with least privilege necessary
- Test in a safe environment first
- Keep backups before running automation

### External Dependencies

This template may reference or suggest external services:
- shields.io for badges
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Package managers (PowerShell Gallery, npm, etc.)

**Recommendations:**
- Verify the integrity of external resources
- Use trusted, official package sources
- Review CI/CD workflows before enabling
- Understand third-party service terms and privacy policies
